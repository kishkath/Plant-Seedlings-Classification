# Plant-Seedlings-Classification

A database of images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages is made publicly available. It comprises annotated RGB images with a physical resolution of roughly 10 pixels per mm. To standardise the evaluation of classification results obtained with the database, a benchmark based on $f_{1}$ scores is proposed.
